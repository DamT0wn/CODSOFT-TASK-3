  CodSoft Internship: Task 3 - Calculator
This repository contains a fully functional calculator application, developed as Task 3 during my virtual internship at CodSoft. This project demonstrates my ability to integrate HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive logic, creating a practical and responsive web-based tool.

Project Highlights:
Interactive Functionality: Implements core calculator operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and handles complex expressions.

User-Friendly Interface: Features a clean and intuitive design, making it easy for users to perform calculations.

Responsive Design: The calculator is designed to adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring usability on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

JavaScript Logic: Showcases proficiency in JavaScript for handling user input, performing calculations, and updating the display dynamically.

Technologies Used:
HTML5: For the basic structure and layout of the calculator's interface.

CSS3: For styling the buttons, display, and overall appearance, ensuring a modern look and feel.

JavaScript: For implementing all the calculator's logic, including handling button clicks, parsing expressions, and calculating results.
